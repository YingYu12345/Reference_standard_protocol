Construction of RNA reference materials for improving the quality of transcriptomic data

RNA reference materials and the corresponding reference datasets that act as the “ground truth” of the measurement values are indispensable tools for assessing the reliability of RNA-seq in detecting intrinsically small biological differences in clinical settings such as those between molecular subtypes of diseases. However, constructing RNA reference datasets is challenging because of the incomparability of conventional “absolute” expression profiles across different batches, methods, or platforms. We recently proposed a ratio-based method for constructing reference datasets. The ratio for a gene is defined as the division of the expression levels between two sample groups and has demonstrated much better agreement than “absolute” data across multiple transcriptomic technologies and batches, resulting in the successful generation of omics-wide reference datasets with satisfied uncertainty. In this protocol, we provide a step-by-step description of the procedures of establishing RNA reference materials and reference datasets, covering the following three stages: (1) reference materials, including material preparation, homogeneity testing, and stability testing; (2) ratio-based reference datasets, including characterization, uncertainty estimation, and orthogonal validation; and (3) applications, including construction of performance metrics, performing proficiency test, and diagnosing and correcting batch effects. The protocol has been used for establishing the Quartet RNA reference materials and reference datasets (chinese-quartet.org) which have been approved as the first suite of certified RNA reference materials by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation as the First Class of National Reference Materials. The protocol can be utilized to establish and/or apply reference materials to improve RNA-seq data quality in diverse clinical utilities.
